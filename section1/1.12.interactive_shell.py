# When using the interactive shell (terminal) the code is not saved. Use the terminal to quickly test code out. 
# for creating a reusable program, create a file and use the text editor. 

# when using the terminal, you can simply type "total_price" instead of "print(total_price)". 
# It will print automatically without explicity calling the print function
#  "print(total_price)" would be for when you're writing in your file.
# to exit the terminal, type exit()
